# Crosses & Circles: The Ultimate Battle

### A application that allows the user to play tic-tac-toe with friends.

#### This application will allow the user to:
- Play Against a **Friend**
- Track Your Win and Loss Record
- Play Against a **Bot**

As someone who enjoys simple games, I love playing tic-tac-toe with friends. This application will allow you to play
tic-tac-toe with your friend or a bot. 

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see how many games I have won and lost
- As a user, I want to have a menu to select what I want to do 
  - play game, view game history, or the win and lost record
- As a user, I want to see a visual of the tic-tac-toe game
- As a user, I want to add my game history to a list of past games played
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the menu, I want to be given the option to save my win-loss record and
previous games
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my previous games and my win-loss 
record

### Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project, I would have cleaned up my program in terms of using more interface and
abstract functions to help reduce the coupling for my project. From the UML diagram, it might seem obvious that there
some classes that do not have a connection to other classes. Given more time, I would make more classes of those type so
that it follows the single responsibility rule. 

Throughout the project, I realized that my initial design of the TicTacToe is flawed. Meaning that I have over-complicated 
a lot of the design. If I had to restart the project, I would design the TicTacToe differently so that it is simpler and
serves only one purpose and not breaking the single responsibility rule that later made coupling very high.
